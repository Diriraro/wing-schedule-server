Description:

The bean 'client', defined in class path resource [co/diro/wing/common/component/HttpComponent.class], could not be registered. A bean with that name has already been defined in class path resource [co/diro/wing/common/component/CommonComponent.class] and overriding is disabled.

Action:

Consider renaming one of the beans or enabling overriding by setting spring.main.allow-bean-definition-overriding=true

Description:

The dependencies of some of the beans in the application context form a cycle:

┌──->──┐
|  httpComponent (field okhttp3.OkHttpClient co.diro.wing.common.component.HttpComponent.client)
└──<-──┘


Action:

Relying upon circular references is discouraged and they are prohibited by default. Update your application to remove the dependency cycle between beans. As a last resort, it may be possible to break the cycle automatically by setting spring.main.allow-circular-references to true.
